# Welcome to IdentityAPI

## Overview

**IdentityAPI** is dedicated to developing robust Django/DRF API applications for managing foundational system functionalities. Our focus lies in providing streamlined solutions for authentication, authorization, and user communication ~ the building blocks of any modern application.

## First, what are the limitations

While managed authentication solutions are robust, they often come with predefined workflows that may not align with specific business requirements. Additionally, these solutions can limit data ownership and typically charge based on the number of users, API requests, or feature tiers—costs that can escalate significantly as your user base grows.

## Second, how IdentityAPI addresses them

**IdentityAPI** introduces AAA — a family of three Django/DRF applications (*Authen*, *Author*, and *Accord*) that together form a comprehensive system, with each app addressing a specific aspect of functionality. Each application is fully customizable to meet unique business needs. Additionally, the core components can be combined in various configurations to suit different requirements, such as: *Authen* alone, *Authen* with *Author*, *Authen* with *Accord*, or the complete suite of *Authen*, *Author*, and *Accord*.
